> #### I've been a Gear Head since I CAN remember, and my first love was and always has been machines. After being a small engine mechanic and working up to heavy equipment, as an Oiler/Fueler and working up to Lowboy Heavy Haul Trucker for various construction and trucking companies, a brilliant idea came to me and I've been a wanna be, working diligently, becoming a Software Engineer, Programmer, Innovator, desparatly hoping for a mericle, living on a shoe string, working 24/7, broke, broken, defeated, battered and suprisingly hopeful that all of my dreams are coming true and soon.

> - ##### Slowly but surely learning coding, app building, website design, graphic design, business ownership, attempting a BA in Computer Science and Technology, and working 60 hours plus as a DoorDash delivery slave. Which is almost as lucrative as living on peanuts, but at least I'm not homeless and living with my parents......  ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜ž

---

>>> ##### "Golden Ticket Safety Equipment(R)"

---

>> ##### 1). IoT, Ai-Enhanced Signaling Device Indicator and Safety Inhancing; 
>> 2). Hands free Synchronous Application  Accumulating Appreciating Systems for Commercial, Emergency, and Highway Maintenance Vehicles to communicate to the motoring public vital information quickly, effctivly and above all safely
>> ##### a). various HD, Glair-Resistant, digtal screens in place of turn signaling lights, though they primary function looking exactly like traditional blinking lights, the screen's glair resistant properties alone enhance safety as glair reduction should help other drivers see signal devices in most weather conditions, with hopes of no glair and not overly bright in darker areas.

> As IoT in warehousing continues to gain prevailance the the Golden Ticket Safety Equipment Enhancing Systems, for Commercial Carriers and Shippers, utilizing Synchronising IoT modules in reuseable palets, air-ride sensors, E-logs, any load can be monitored with absolute real time precision, with each pallots weight, temperature and ETA nearly down to the second.
