>> #### I've been a Gear-Headed Machine-Loving member of the Human-Race ever-since I CAN; remember, and my first love was and always has been machines. As the Comedian Ron White said, "You got a car that's broke you fix it, a tractor that's stuck you can pull it out, a home appliace that's malfunctioning you can replace it, but you can't fix stupid." And as the character Forest Gump said "Stupid is, as Stupid Does." As I say "Never call someone else stupid, as pointing a finger creates 3 pointing back at you and a thumb pointing to GOD/ or higher power that happends to live in the sky for some reason, effectivly saying, "I am 3 times more stupid, than that person over there, and there's a higher power resposible who is also stupid" which sounds like non-sense now that i've typed it out and read it back silently to myself.

>> After being a small engine mechanic and working up to heavy equipment, as an Oiler/Fueler and working up to Lowboy Heavy Haul Trucker for various construction and trucking companies, a brilliant idea came to me and I've been a wanna be, working diligently, becoming a Software Engineer, Programmer, Innovator, desparatly hoping for a mericle, living on a shoe string, working 24/7, broke, broken, defeated, battered and suprisingly hopeful that all of my dreams are coming true and soon, **unique X-Press-ION; of a unique individual, with li-ber-ty and just-ice for all.**

> - ##### Slowly but surely learning coding, app building, website design, graphic design, business ownership, attempting a BA in Computer Science and Technology, and working 60 hours plus as a DoorDash delivery slave. Which is almost as lucrative as living on peanuts, but at least I'm not homeless and living with my parents......  ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜ž

>> ####  Current Projects:

---

>>> ##### "Golden Ticket Safety Equipment(R)"

---

>> ##### 1). IoT, Ai-Enhanced Signaling Device Indicator and Safety Inhancing; 
>> 2). Hands free Synchronous Application  Accumulating Appreciating Systems for Commercial, Emergency, and Highway Maintenance Vehicles to communicate to the motoring public vital information quickly, effctivly and above all safely
>> ##### a). various HD, Glair-Resistant, digtal screens in place of turn signaling lights, though they primary function looking exactly like traditional blinking lights, the screen's glair resistant properties alone enhance safety as glair reduction should help other drivers see signal devices in most weather conditions, with hopes of no glair and not overly bright in darker areas.

> As IoT in warehousing continues to gain prevailance the the Golden Ticket Safety Equipment Enhancing Systems, for Commercial Carriers and Shippers, utilizing Synchronising IoT modules in reuseable palets, air-ride sensors, E-logs, any load can be monitored with absolute real time precision, with each pallots weight, temperature and ETA nearly down to the second.
